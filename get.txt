In Node.js, "get" primarily refers to two distinct concepts: the GET HTTP method for retrieving data from a server, and the JavaScript get keyword (getter) for accessing object properties. 
1. app.get() in Express.js (HTTP Routing) 
The most common use of "get" in the context of Node.js web development is with the Express.js framework's app.get() method. This method is used to define a route handler that specifically listens for incoming HTTP GET requests. 
Purpose: GET requests are the standard way for a client (like a web browser) to request data or a resource from the server. They are used for operations that are "read-only" and do not modify data on the server, such as fetching a webpage, retrieving a list of products, or performing a search.
Syntax: app.get(path, callback) where path is the URL route (e.g., /users) and callback is a function that executes when a request is made to that path. This function takes request (req) and response (res) objects as arguments.
