Node.js is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, typically for building fast and scalable server-side and networking applications. 
Key Features
Server-Side JavaScript Node.js enables backend development using JavaScript, unifying web application development around a single language and allowing developers to become full-stack JavaScript developers.
Event-Driven & Non-Blocking I/O It uses a single-threaded event loop and non-blocking input/output (I/O) model, which makes it highly efficient for handling many concurrent connections without waiting for operations like file or database access to complete.
High Performance Built on Google Chrome's high-performance V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js compiles JavaScript source code to native machine code at runtime, contributing to its speed.
Rich Ecosystem (npm) Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager), the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries in the world. This allows developers to easily install and manage third-party packages and modules, significantly speeding up the development process.
Cross-Platform It can run on various operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux. 
Common Use Cases
Node.js is well-suited for building high-performance, data-intensive applications: 
REST APIs and Backend Services Widely used for creating robust backend services and APIs for web and mobile applications, often with frameworks like Express.js.
Real-Time Applications Its event-driven architecture is ideal for applications requiring instant, two-way communication, such as chat apps, online games, and live streaming services.
Microservices The lightweight nature of Node.js makes it suitable for building applications using a microservices architecture.
Command-Line Tools It's a popular choice for creating command-line interface (CLI) tools and automated scripts.
