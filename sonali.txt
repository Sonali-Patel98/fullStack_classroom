about Artificial Intelligence (AI) is technology enabling machines to simulate human intelligence, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making from data to perform tasks like understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making predictions, powering everything from search engines and virtual assistants to medical diagnosis and self-driving cars. It works by using algorithms to learn from vast amounts of data, allowing systems to adapt and improve without explicit programming for every scenario, making them increasingly integral to daily life and various industries.
